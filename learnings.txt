        -t           -> tag to identify the image
        hello-docker -> Specifying the docker file name
        .            -> Referencing the current directory
    $ docker build -t hello-docker .

List all docker image
    docker image ls
    docker images

Run the image
    docker run hello-docker

List Docker processes
    docker ps //shows only running containers
    docker ps -a //shows all containers with stopped containers

Pull a docker image
    docker run <image_name>
    docker run -it <image_name> //run container in interactive mode(-it stands for interactive)

whoami -> Shows current user
echo $0 -> shows location of the shell program
history -> shows all command history // !2 will run the second command from the history
apt update -> update package database
apt install <package_name>-> install a package
apt remove <package_name>-> remove a package

    cat <file_name> -> show the content of a file //cat refer to concatenate
    more <file_name> -> see long content
    less <file_location> -> see long content with scroll
    head -n 5 /etc/adduser.conf -> shows first 5 lines of the file
    tail -n 5 /etc/adduser.conf -> shows last 5 lines of the file
    cat file1.txt file2.txt -> print by combining
    cat file1.txt file2.txt > combined.txt -> combines and saves into new file (redirection operator)
    echo hello > hello.txt -> save a new file with the texts
    ls -l /etc > longlist.txt
